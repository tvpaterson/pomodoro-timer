
# Pomodoro Timer ‚è±

This Pomodoro Tracker allows you to manage time and set the concentration time as a cycle. 
This allows you to strike a balance between your work and breaks with minimum interruptions 
and make time management more intuitive and effective. By default, each work period lasts 25 
minutes and then followed by a 5-minute break, you can choose to have additional breaks if required
by pressing either the *short break* button or the *long break* button.

I made this small application as, in the past, I frequently used the pomodoro technique whilst
working as I felt it stopped me from working non-stop as I would often do and force me to have
a break. Some benefits of using the pomodoro technique (and this timer üòâ ) are:

- Allows you to deal with any distractions
- Reduces burn out
- Helps with time management
- Increases productivity
- Improves planning
- Reduces mental fatigue
